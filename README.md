Streamlining-Cranberry-Processing-A-Simulation-Based-Approach-for-NCC

Background:
National Cranberry Cooperative (NCC) aimed to enhance its capacity planning to reduce truck waiting times and ensure efficient processing of cranberries.

 Project Details:

1. Process Flow Diagram:**
    - Developed a detailed process flow diagram to map out the entire cranberry processing workflow.
    - Identified key areas within the processing line, specifically focusing on capacities and potential bottlenecks that could hinder the efficiency.

2. **Simulation Analysis:**
    - Conducted three simulations focusing on the dryer area, a critical part of the processing line.
    - Each simulation was designed to test the impact of different capacity enhancement strategies on the overall processing time and truck waiting times.

3. **Results:**
    - The simulation results indicated that adding additional dryers would effectively eliminate the waiting times for trucks.
    - This led to a smoother flow through the processing line, ensuring timely processing of cranberries.

4. **Financial Analysis:**
    - A comprehensive financial analysis was conducted to evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for adding new dryers.
    - The analysis considered the costs of purchasing and installing new dryers against the benefits of reduced waiting times and increased efficiency.

5. **Recommendations:**
    - Based on the positive simulation results and financial analysis, it was recommended that NCC invest in additional dryers.
    - The investment was projected to have a positive ROI and significantly improve the processing efficiency.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Business Process Analysis:** Thorough analysis of the cranberry processing workflow to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Financial Modeling:** Detailed financial analysis to assess the cost-benefit of capacity enhancements.
- Strategic Planning:** Development of strategic recommendations based on simulation and financial analysis to improve operational efficiency.

How to Use the Analysis:
1. Understand the Process Flow:**
    - Review the process flow diagram to get a clear picture of the entire processing workflow and identify key areas of focus.

2. Analyze Simulation Results:**
    - Examine the simulation data to understand the impact of different capacity enhancement strategies.

3. Evaluate Financial Implications:**
    - Look into the financial analysis to assess the feasibility and ROI of the proposed recommendations.

4. Implement Recommendations:**
    - Use the insights and recommendations provided to make informed decisions about capacity enhancements to improve operational efficiency.
